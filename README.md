# Introduction

This is a template starter application with an Angular.io SPA front-end and .NET Core back-end.

## FAQ

- Is this a low-code or no-code solution? - No. You must know how to code and be familiar with languages, frameworks and libraries like HTML, CSS, TypeScript, C# ASP.NET Core, Angular, Bootstrap, and Entity Framework Core.
- Is this a framework? - No. This is an application architecture that is composed of other frameworks to demonstrate specific patterns and techniques for quickly building business applications at the FDOT.
- Why have this template available? - We want to have a standard approach so that when we build applications we are doing it the same way. When somebody leaves and the new person comes in, we pick it up and understand whatâ€™s going on.
- When will we start implementing this solution/approach? - Immediately

## Getting Started

### Install the Following Tools

1. [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)
2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator) and [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/)
4. Node.js and NPM: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
5. SQL Server and [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017)

### Prerequisite Configuration - 1 Time Setup

> VS Code - Install the necessary extensions. The highlighted extensions are either required or highly recommended. The others are very useful.

![alt text](Documentation/vscode_extensions.png "VS Code extensions")

> VS Code or Command Terminal - Verify that you have the latest .NET Core SDK

![alt text](Documentation/dotnet_config.png ".NET Core CLI Commands to verify SDK installation")

> Contact Randy `randy.lee@dot.state.fl.us` to obtain the necessary client secrets for the Azure Identity Providers and APIs. This is a JSON file that will be stored on the developers workstation and NEVER committed to Git.

> An explaination of user secrets... Using the Azure platform requires access to services that provide things like identity management and authentication, SMTP (email), and FDOT enterprise data. These services require a secret (password) for each application. The EDAT Template has been assigned secrets for you to use during development. Once your application is ready to be deployed to Azure TEST, you will need to request secrets that are specific to your application.

### Download and Run the [PowerShell Script](https://fdot.visualstudio.com/EDAT/_git/CloneTemplate?path=%2FopenEDAT_Template.ps1&version=GBmaster&_a=contents) to Create a New Application from the Template. Thank you, Jim (if you have any issues, please contact Jim - james.quinn@dot.state.fl.us)

> You will need to unblock the PowerShell script before you execute it!

#### Warning

> This will take several minutes to complete due to the NPM package installation.

> Save the secrets.json file in the `{your-project-name}` project folder. The .gitignore file is already configured to ignore this file, but please verify. See the image below for the project structure. Notice that the `{your-project-name}` project is the .NET Core project and the `ClientApp` folder contains the Angular application.

![alt text](Documentation/vscode_project_structure.png "Project structure")

> VS Code or Command Terminal - Use the `dotnet` CLI to set the user secrets.

![alt text](Documentation/set_user_secrets.png "Using dotnet CLI to save user secrets")

> This will copy the secrets.json file to a folder in your profile's `AppData`

![alt text](Documentation/app_data_user_secrets.png "User secrets stored in AppData")

> The .NET Core compiler will look for these secrets and combine them with the project's appsettings.json. The compiler looks for user secrets based on the key in the project file.

### Run Template

> VS Code - In the Debug Menu (Ctrl + Shift + D), select `ASP.Net Core & Browser` and Hit Play! VS Code will automatically execute the `dotnet build` and `ng serve` commands and start Chrome. You can debug the .NET Core code by setting breakpoints in VS Code and debug the Angular application in Chrome developer tools.

![alt text](Documentation/vscode_debug.png "Run in VS Code")

> _What about Visual Studio? Can I still use it?_ Yes. After the project is configured, you can choose to use Visual Studio as your IDE. Debugging in Visual Studio will use IIS Express as the development server, whereas debugging in VS Code will use the Angular CLI (Node) server.<br/><br/>_Where is the unit test project, and where are the client testing frameworks and configuration?_ They have been removed in an effort to keep the code as simple and straight-forward as possible. Please feel free to add a .NET Core unit test project and add the Jasmine test framework back to Angular.

### Manual Steps to Create a New Application from the Template

1. Rename the extract folder to `{your-project-name}`
2. Rename the `EdatTemplate` folder to `{your-project-name}`
3. Rename the `EdatTemplate.sln` file to `{your-project-name}.sln`
4. Open the `{your-project-name}` folder
5. Rename the `EdatTemplate.csproj` file to `{your-project-name}.csproj`
6. VS Code - open the `{your-project-name}` folder
7. VS Code - Edit -> Replace in Files `EdatTemplate` with `{your-project-name]` and select "Replace All" (Ctrl + ALt + Enter)
8. VS Code (optional) - Set the `UserSecretsId` in the .NET Core project to a new value (usually a GUID) and reload new secrets for your new application. All applications deployed on Azure will require their own unique secrets, but developers can use the ones provided by Randy for local development.
9. VS Code - Hit Play! This will run these commands in order...
   - From `{your-project-name}` it runs `dotnet build` -> This restores NuGet packages, builds the .NET Core app, and generates the TypeScript model definition files (model.d.ts)
   - From `{your-project-name}\ClientApp` it runs `npm install` -> This creates the `node_modules` folder and installs the NPM packages defined in the `package.json` file.
   - From `{your-project-name}\ClientApp` it runs `ng serve` -> This builds the client app and starts the Angular-CLI server.
10. Images are served from the `{your-project-name}\ClientApp\dist\assets` folder. Running in VS Code will not create this folder since the Angular-CLI server serves files from in-memory. To get get the images for your application, run `npm run build` from inside the `{your-project-name}\ClientApp` folder at least once.
