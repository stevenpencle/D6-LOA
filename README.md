## Introduction

This is a template starter application with an Angular.io SPA front-end and .NET Core back-end.

![alt text](Documentation/edat_template.png "EDAT Template")

### FAQ

- Is this a low-code or no-code solution? - No. You must know how to code and be familiar with languages, frameworks and libraries like HTML, CSS, TypeScript, C# ASP.NET Core, Angular, Bootstrap, and Entity Framework Core.
- Is this a framework? - No. This is an application architecture that is composed of other frameworks to demonstrate specific patterns and techniques for quickly building business applications at the FDOT.
- Why have this template available? - We want to have a standard approach so that when we build applications we are doing it the same way. When somebody leaves and the new person comes in, we pick it up and understand whatâ€™s going on.
- When will we start implementing this solution/approach? - Immediately

## Getting Started

### Install the Following Tools

1. [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) - currently using .NET Core 2.1
2. [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. [Azure Storage Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-use-emulator) and [Azure Storage Explorer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/features/storage-explorer/)
4. Node.js and NPM: [https://nodejs.org/en/](https://nodejs.org/en/)
5. SQL Server and [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017)
6. Visual Studio 2017 (optional, but provides better server-side debugging) - make sure all updates are installed

### Prerequisite Configuration - 1 Time Setup

VS Code - Install the necessary extensions. The highlighted extensions are either required or highly recommended. The others are very useful.

![alt text](Documentation/vscode_extensions.png "VS Code extensions")

VS Code or Command Terminal - Verify that you have the latest .NET Core SDK

![alt text](Documentation/dotnet_config.png ".NET Core CLI Commands to verify SDK installation")

Contact Randy `randy.lee@dot.state.fl.us` to obtain the necessary client secrets for the Azure Identity Providers and APIs. This is a JSON file that will be stored on the developers workstation and NEVER committed to Git.

![alt text](Documentation/secrets_json.png "secrets.json file you will need")

An explaination of user secrets... Using the Azure platform requires access to services that provide things like identity management and authentication, SMTP (email), and FDOT enterprise data. These services require a secret (password) for each application. The EDAT Template has been assigned secrets for you to use during development. Once your application is ready to be deployed to Azure TEST, you will need to request secrets that are specific to your application.

### Download and Run the [PowerShell Script](https://fdot.visualstudio.com/EDAT/_git/CloneTemplate?path=%2FopenEDAT_Template.ps1&version=GBmaster&_a=contents) to Create a New Application from the Template

A special _Thank you!_ to Jim Quinn. If you have any issues, please contact Jim - `james.quinn@dot.state.fl.us`

You will need to unblock the PowerShell script before you execute it!

![alt text](Documentation/powershell_security_setting.png "Allow the PowerShell script to execute")

#### Warning

This will take several minutes to complete due to the NPM package installation.

![alt text](Documentation/powershell_script_run.png "PowerShell script execution end")

Save the secrets.json file in the `{your-project-name}` project folder. The .gitignore file is already configured to ignore this file, but please verify. See the image below for the project structure. Notice that the `{your-project-name}` project is the .NET Core project and the `ClientApp` folder contains the Angular application.

![alt text](Documentation/vscode_project_structure.png "Project structure")

VS Code or Command Terminal - Use the `dotnet` CLI to set the user secrets.

![alt text](Documentation/set_user_secrets.png "Using dotnet CLI to save user secrets")

This will copy the secrets.json file to a folder in your profile's `AppData`

![alt text](Documentation/app_data_user_secrets.png "User secrets stored in AppData")

The .NET Core compiler will look for these secrets and combine them with the project's appsettings.json. The compiler looks for user secrets based on the key in the project file.

![alt text](Documentation/user_secrets_project_setting.png "User secrets key in project file")

### Run Template

VS Code - In the Debug Menu (Ctrl + Shift + D), select `ASP.Net Core & Browser` and Hit Play! VS Code will automatically execute the `dotnet build` and `ng serve` commands and start Chrome. You can debug the .NET Core code by setting breakpoints in VS Code and debug the Angular application in Chrome developer tools.

## Template Application Architecture

![alt text](Documentation/template_architecture.jpg "Template Architecture")

### General Overview

We need to think of development using the Template Application Architecture as creating two separate applications, a server application and a client application. The only aspect or information that is shared between the two is the model, and the only communication between the two is with client services making requests to server API controllers. The following is a detailed breakdown of the various tiers and components, and the responsibilities they have in the architecture.

### Model

![alt text](Documentation/template_architecture_model.jpg "Model")

The model can be thought of as "glue" code in that it represents the structure of information that is shared between the server and client applications and is what binds them together. The source code for the model resides in the .NET Core application _Model_ namespace, and the model classes are typically just _POCOs_ (plain ole C# objects). The _Model_ namespace is further categorized by the scope namespaces of _Domain_, _Security_, and _View_. The Template Architecture uses the _ReinforcedTypings_ NuGet package to generate a TypeScript definition file (\*.d.ts) that contains each model type during the MSBuild process. The _ReinforcedTypingsConfiguration.cs_ must be updated to add new model types to the code generation build step.

#### Model: Domain

The _Domain_ namespace is where entities that represent the business domain are located. These are typically the _Entity Framework_ classes that represent the Azure SQL (or local SQL Server) database objects. The Template Architecture defines the _Entity_ class to be used as a base class for other entities. Other business domain representations can also be defined here, like the _Staff_ entity which is the payload type for the _StaffService_ and not represented by a database table.

- **Entity** The base class for other entities.
- **Staff** The object type returned by the _StaffService_.
- **{Your Entities}** Entities that represent the business domain of your application.

**A note about application state:** It is critically important that there is a single source of truth (or single representation of state) in the application. Having multiple representations of the same state is the primary cause of application bugs and unnecessary complexity. There are three tiers where state must be managed in an application, the data store (Azure SQL), the application server (.NET Core application), and the client (Angular application). Since these are separate state representations in distributed applications, it is the developer's responsibility to have only a single representation of state in each tier and to keep them synchronized. The _Domain_ model is the representation of state for the application, and _Entity Framework_ is the framework used to keep the state synchronized between the data store and application server. We will discuss how state is managed in the client application later in the _service stores_ section.

#### Model: Security

The _Security_ namespace is where we define types that represent the security context and current principal of the application to be shared with the client application. These types include:

- **AuthProviderConfig** Describes the security context of the application such as whether role impersonation is allowed for development/testing and if the application supports Azure B2C authentication. This is a singleton type that is deserialized from _appsettings.json_.
- **ClientToken** Describes the current user and his roles so the client application understands what functions the user is authorized to perform. The _ClientToken_ is transported to the client application in plain text and is not tamper-proof, but this is okay. Its only purpose is to provide the information necessary for the client application to evaluate how it should render menu options and what routes should be available. All security checks will be performed in the server application's API controllers against the current principal that is deserialized from the encrypted authentication token obtained from Azure AD / B2C.

#### Model: View

The _View_ namespace is where we define types that represent transient state messages between client and server. These types include:

- **DocumentMetadata** Describes the information about a BLOB stored with the _StorageController_.
- **EdatFooter** Describes the image resources and links for the standard FDOT application footer. This is a singleton type that is deserialized from _appsettings.json_.
- **EdatHeader** Describes the image resources and links for the standard FDOT application header. This is a singleton type that is deserialized from _appsettings.json_.
- **EmailMessage** Describes the structure of an email message for use with the _EmailController_.
- **GraphData, GraphDataPoint, and GraphSeries** Represents data used for binding to _ngx charts_ and _chart-to-table_ components.
- **StringRequest and StringReponse** Represents any string data payload between client and server.

### .NET Core Server Application

The .NET Core Server Application is responsible for handling requests from the client application, evaluating security concerns for those requests, validating that entity state changes adhere to business rules, synchronizing state changes with the data store, and managing access to Azure PaaS services. The server application uses _NuGet_ as the standard package management service.

#### Server: Bootstapper

The _Program_ class handles pre-start host configuration and creates an instance of the _Startup_ class to configure application aspects like _Entity Framework_, _Open ID_ identity providers, and service dependency injection.

#### Server: Security

![alt text](Documentation/template_architecture_security.jpg "Security")

The _Security_ namespace is where we define constants for roles, claims, and authentication types, describe options for using the Azure identity providers, and implement event handlers for those identity providers. These types include:

- **ApplicationAuthenticationType, ApplicationClaims, and ApplicationsRoles** Constant value classes to ensure the integrity of security-related string keys used in the application.
- **B2COpenIdConnectEvents and B2EOpenIdConnectEvents** Event handlers for authentication success and failure conditions for the identity providers.
- **OpenIdConnectB2COptions, OpenIdConnectB2EOptions, and OpenIdConnectOptions** Describes the configuration to be used for the identity providers in startup. These are singleton types that are deserialized from _appsettings.json_.

#### Server: ORM

![alt text](Documentation/template_architecture_orm.jpg "ORM")

The _ORM_ namespace is where we implement the _Entity Framework_ DbContext, configuration, and helpers.

- **EntityContext** This is the DbContext class that defines how our _Domain_ model entity types should be serialized to the data store.
- **EntityFrameworkConfig** Describes the runtime context for _Entity Framework_ such as whether to drop and create the database during development and if the SQL command logger should only log distinct commands. This is a singleton type that is deserialized from _appsettings.json_.
- **NLogSqlInterceptor** This is the logging class for _NLog_ that we use to generate a log of database commands with parameters that is formatted for execution in _SQL Server Management Studio_. This is the log that should be provided to your DBA for the SQL review.

**A note about repositories:** There are none. The primary purpose for the repository pattern is to hide the entity query and serialization details. This is typically necessary to accommodate good automated unit tests where repository mocks are used to test other business logic. _Entity Framework_ does not provide an abstraction of the DbContext or DbSet, but it does provide an "InMemory" database option with transactional scope to facilitate testing. This eliminates the need to mock repositories, so they are not used. If you prefer, you are welcome to use a repository pattern, but I find that it just adds an unnecessary tier to the application.

**A note about lazy loading:** Don't do it, it is an anti-pattern. While _Entity Framework_ supports lazy loading, the Template Application has it disabled by default. Always eager load the data you need for the transaction in the query.

#### Server: Infrastructure

![alt text](Documentation/template_architecture_infrastructure.jpg "Infrastructure")

The _Infrastructure_ namespace is where we implement the services that communicate with other services that are not contained within the application but that the application depends on. You should create services here that interface with Azure PaaS services or other enterprise services. These services should never be instantiated directly but should instead be coupled with an interface and dependency injected where needed. The goal here is to hide the implementation details as much as possible from the application since the application is not in control of potential changes to the external services.

- **AzureStorageConfig** Describes the connection details for the application's Azure Storage container. This is a singleton type that is deserialized from _appsettings.json_.
- **BlobStorageProvider** Service implementation for interfacing with Azure Storage.
- **EmailService** Service implementation for interfacing with the SendGrid service on Azure.
- **FdotCoreApis** Describes the Arculus service endpoints and client configuration for accessing the FDOT enterprise services. This is a singleton type that is deserialized from _appsettings.json_.
- **SendGridConfig** Describes the connection details for using the SendGrid service on Azure. This is a singleton type that is deserialized from _appsettings.json_.
- **StaffService** Service implementation for interfacing with the Staff service on Arculus. The _FdotCoreApis_ configuration also defines endpoints for the _OrgCodes_ and _DotCodes_ services on Arculus, but you will need to implement your own application services if you need to use those. Only the _StaffService_ was implemented since it is so commonly used in applications.

#### Server: Services

![alt text](Documentation/template_architecture_services.jpg "Services")

The _Services_ namespace is where we implement the interface contracts that describe the _Infrastructure_ service implementations.

- **IBlobStorageProvider** Interface for _Infrastructure BlobStorageProvider_.
- **IEmailService** Interface for _Infrastructure EmailService_.
- **IStaffService** Interface for _Infrastructure StaffService_.

#### Server: Controllers

![alt text](Documentation/template_architecture_controllers.jpg "Controllers")

The _Controllers_ namespace is where we implement the APIs for the endpoints exposed by the server application. Controllers have the sole responsibility for enforcing security concerns within the application.

- **Email** API for sending an email via the _IEmailService_.
- **Security** API for retrieving a _ClientToken_ and impersonation (in development). Unlike the other controllers, the _Security_ controller also exposes some synchronous endpoints for redirecting to the _Open ID_ identity providers for authentication.
- **Site** API for retrieving global site data like header and footer resources.
- **Staff** API for accessing the _IStaffService_.
- **Storage** API for accessing the _IBlobStorageProvider_.
- **{Your Controllers}** APIs that you create for your application will manage the implementation of state changes to your entities. Again, please make sure you use the _Authorize()_ attribute appropriately to enforce security on your APIs. A good pattern for entity data validation is to validate any business rules that span over a set of entities within the controller. Validation rules that pertain only to the entity instance should be implemented within the entity itself using _DataAnnotations_ and the _IValidatableObject.Validate()_ method. Using this approach allows you to return a _BadRequest(ModelState) IActionResult_ and the client application's _http service_ will expose the list of validation errors to the client store service which in turn can be handed off to the calling component for processing.

### Angular Client Application

The Angular Client Application is responsible for rendering the user interface of the application appropriately based on the user context and data state (workflow), handling all user interactions, managing the state of the application data in scope, and interfacing with the server application's APIs . The client application uses _NPM_ as the standard package management service.

#### Client: Bootstrapper

The _main.ts_ is the client entry point and bootstraps the _app.module_.

#### Client: app.module

The _app.module_ imports the component declarations, other module imports (including _app-routing.module_), and service providers, and then bootstraps the entry component _app.component_. Any time you add a new component or service, it must be added to the _app.module_.

#### Client: app-routing.module

The _app-routing.module_ is where all client application routes (URLs) are defined. Routes can optionally use the _route-guard_ with a data object to restrict access to specific roles. This is based on evaluating the _ClientToken_ and is not tamper-proof, but it serves the purpose of implementing a consistent UI workflow.

#### Client: services

![alt text](Documentation/template_architecture_client_services.jpg "Services")

The _services_ folder is where all client services are located (except stores). Services are basically just JavaScript (TypeScript) objects that can be injected into components to provide some function. Try to adhere to a single-responsibility principle when designing your services. Also, it is important to understand how the Angular injector decides what scope a service has. This is especially important with any service that manages application state (i.e. stores). The Template Architecture only imports (provides) services in the _app.module_ which means all services are singletons and shared across all components. This is typically what you want, but there may be cases when you want a component to have its own instance of a service.

##### data

- **blob** Provides access to the server's _Storage_ controller. This service does not maintain any state.
- **data-marshaler** Provides a means to pass string data from one component to another. This service maintains a string payload state.
- **data-navigation** Provides a means to sort, filter, and page through a data array. This service does not maintain any state.
- **email** Provides access to the server's _Email_ controller. This service does not maintain any state.
- **excel-export** Provides a means to export a JSON data array to a Microsoft Excel file. This service does not maintain any state.
- **ngbMomentDatePickerAdapter** Extension service for the ng-bootstrap date picker component to use moment.js objects instead of the proprietary structure.
- **staff** Provides access to the server's _Staff_ controller. This service does not maintain any state.

##### environment

The _environment_ service provides a means for the Angular router to compose URLs by specifying the application root path ('/' is the default). This service does not maintain any state.

##### http

The _http_ service is a wrapper around Angular's http service that has been extended to handle _ModelState_ error and unauthorized responses. This is the http service your services and stores should use. This service does not maintain any state.

##### security

- **route-guard** Used in a declarative manner in the _app-routing.module_ to restrict access to routes not authorized for the principal's _ClientToken_ roles. This service does not maintain any state.
- **security** Provides a means to access the principal's _ClientToken_ from the _Security_ controller. This service maintains the client application's state of the _ClientToken_ and is a subscription (store) service.

##### {Your Store Services}

Your store services that represent the state management of your application's data should be placed in the _features_ folder.

Store services are a special type of service that manages the state of some 'subject' and notifies all subscribers of any changes to that subject's state. This is how you will manage your model's state in the client application, and this is the most typical type of custom service you will implement. Your application model entities should always be managed by store services, and the same entity type should never be the subject of more than one store service (directly or indirectly). This is how we ensure a single source of truth in the client application.

Store services extend the _subscriberService_ and use the _subscriberHelper_ to manage the subscribers (observers) of the subject they manage. The subject can be any object, object graph, or array of objects. It is up to you to decide how you will compose your stores based on the model and workflow of your application.

**A note about store services:** Store services use the _RxJS_ library which is an integral part of Angular. The subject of a store services is a _BehaviorSubject_ type which is an observable and observer. Components that use store services should implement _OnInit_ and must implement _OnDestroy_. Typically, you will subscribe to the store service in the _ngOnInit()_ method to 'observe' the service's subject and provide a callback to handle state change notifications for that subject. You should always unsubscribe to any store services in the _ngOnDestroy_ method. Failure to do this will result in a memory leak in the client application.

#### Client: components

![alt text](Documentation/template_architecture_client_components.jpg "Components")

The _components_ folder is where all client general use components are located. The components you build for your application will typically go in the _features_ folder. Components are basically just JavaScript (TypeScript) objects with an associated HTML template. It is up to you to decide how to compose your application's views with components, but generally you should try to keep components as small as possible for reusability. A component can be as small as a single button like the Template Application's _sort-button_ or can be more complex like the _file-upload_ component. Components are often composed of other components like the Template Application's _sample-data_ component. This component uses the _sort-button_, _filter-field_, and _sample-modal_ components. The _sample-modal_ component in turn uses the _staff-picker_ component. Any view within your application is typically composed of many components in what is referred to as the component tree. It is very important to begin to think of your application in terms of component composition views instead of 'page' views.

**A note about component state:** Components only manage their own state. This is typically just state that tracks user actions or state assigned from the evaluation of a store service's subject and is used to hide or show certain sections of the component's template. Component state is always transient whereas service state is always deliberatly scoped (typically global).

##### app

The _app_ component is the main component of the client application and is the 'root' of the application's component tree. The most important aspect of this component is that it contains the Angular _router-outlet_ component which has the responsibility of injecting the component associated with the current route (URL) into the component tree. It also has a custom 'fast route' implementation that will re-route the user to the deep link URL they requested after authentication if that link is access restricted. This scenario is typical of a URL sent in an email that is restricted to a specific role or roles.

##### common

Common components are utility components that serve very specific technical puposes unrelated the business domain of the application.

- **chart-to-table** Switches the graphical SVG view of an ngx-charts chart to a tabular view of the bound data for accessibility requirements.
- **file-upload** Provides a view for selecting and uploading files.
- **filter-field** Provides a view for entering string data to applied as a filter to a property in a set of data.
- **sort-button** Provides a view for sorting data ascending or descending.
- **staff-picker** Provides a type-ahead select for FDOT staff (SRS).

##### footer

The _footer_ component renders the standard FDOT footer in an accessible and responsive format. This component does bend the rule about making a direct http call to the _Site_ controller, but this is mitigated by the fact that this is a one-time call for static data.

##### header

The _header_ component renders the standard FDOT header in an accessible and responsive format. This component does bend the rule about making a direct http call to the _Site_ controller, but this is mitigated by the fact that this is a one-time call for static data.

##### home

The _home_ component is the 'landing page' of your application. You will need to modify this component's template to provide the introduction and purpose of your application.

##### nav-menu

The _nav-menu_ component is the menu for your application. It already contains the 'home' link and authentication links for Azure AD and B2C. You will need to modify this component to reflect the navigation structure of your application.

##### not-authorized

The _not-authorized_ component is where the _http_ service re-routes a user when they receive a 403 (unauthorized) response from a server application API call. This should not happen if you use the _route-guard_ for restricting route access to appropriate roles and the _security_ service to subscribe to the _ClientToken_ for evaluating whether or not a user is allowed to make the API call (in other words, don't render actions that the user is not authorized to perform).

##### server-error

The _server-error_ component's sole purpose is to render the detailed .NET Core error page in an iframe for debugging. This is a development-only component.

##### {Your Components}

Your components that represent the functions and views of your application should be placed in the _features_ folder.

#### Client: features

The _features_ folder is where should place the components and store services that represent the business domain of your application. You should break up features by 'areas' that represent distinct sections or functionality within your application.

## Questions

_**What about Visual Studio? Can I still use it?**_

Yes. After the project is configured, you can choose to use Visual Studio as your IDE. Debugging in Visual Studio will use IIS Express as the development server, whereas debugging in VS Code will use the Angular CLI (Node) server.

_Caution: If you use both Visual Studio and VS Code, be aware that debugging in Visual Studio will result in IIS Express blocking port 44376 until you manually exit it in your system tray. If you leave IIS Express running and then try to debug in VS Code, you will get an error._

_**Where is the unit test project, and where are the client testing frameworks and configuration?**_

They have been removed in an effort to keep the code as simple and straight-forward as possible. Please feel free to add a .NET Core unit test project and add the Jasmine test framework back to Angular.

_**I am so sick of the template theme. How do I change it?**_

The EDAT Template supports [SASS styling](https://sass-lang.com/). the SASS files (.scss) are compiled to CSS as part of the build process. There are currently two built-in Bootstrap themes available, `office` (default) and `fdot`. You can change the theme in `{your-project-name}\ClientApp\src\styles\styles.scss`

![alt text](Documentation/sass_themes.png "SASS themes")

Commenting out the `_theme_office.scss` and uncommenting the `_theme_fdot.scss` changes the application theme to standard FDOT colors.

![alt text](Documentation/_theme_fdot.png "SASS themes")

Please feel free to create your own themes, and please be sure to share with the rest of us. Currently, all themes must meet one of the approved [FDOT color palettes](http://www.fdot.gov/it/docs/standards/colorpalette-10252013.htm)

[Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery) is included in the template as our glyph library.

_**What do I need to know about the application configuration (appsettings.json) besides the user secrets already mentioned?**_

Here's a cheat-sheet of the more important settings and what their purpose is.

![alt text](Documentation/appsettings_help.png "appsettings help")

_**What do I need to know about the application's security model and how does it work?**_

The `OpenIdConnectB2EOptions:Roles` setting (appsettings.json) is where you define the roles your application will use for network users. In the template application the `Admin` role will be assigned to any authenticated network user that belongs to any of the security groups listed in the array. You will need to use the Azure Portal to determine the Object IDs for the security groups you are using as your application roles.

![alt text](Documentation/security_group.png "Azure AD security groups")

In `B2EOpenIdConnectEvents.cs` the principal's role claim will be assigned the admin role (i.e. `Admin`) if the user is a member of the AS-EDAT security group (i.e. `d13a3eb1-9867-4796-8ae5-7fd75e724613`).

![alt text](Documentation/role_assignment_code.png "Role assignment code")

_IMPORTANT:_ You should use the standard `Authorize()` attribute to decorate your .NET API controllers/methods that are secured (access restricted). This is the primary security layer within the application.

![alt text](Documentation/authorize_attribute.png "Authorize attribute")

In the Angular `app-routing.module.ts` you should use the `RouteGuard` to restrict access to routes by user role. This is not a security aspect in that roles can be spoofed on the client browser by tech-savvy people, but it helps make the security intentions within the application clearer and helps prevents users from accessing routes that will result in an unauthorized (403) response code when an API call is made.

![alt text](Documentation/route_guard.png "RouteGuard")

It is also the developer's responsibility to render only the application menu options that are accessible by the current user's role. This is handled by subscribing to the `SecurityService` (security.service.ts) in the `ngOnInit` lifecycle event of your component. See the example below from the `nav-menu.component.(ts|html)`.

![alt text](Documentation/security_service_component.png "SecurityService use in a component")

![alt text](Documentation/ngif_role_eval_in_template.png "Evaluating the role in the template with *ngIf")

Role assignment for B2C users must be handled via a custom user/role management implementation in your application since these users are not in AD.

## Manual Steps to Create a New Application from the Template

1. Rename the extract folder to `{your-project-name}`
2. Rename the `EdatTemplate` folder to `{your-project-name}`
3. Rename the `EdatTemplate.sln` file to `{your-project-name}.sln`
4. Open the `{your-project-name}` folder
5. Rename the `EdatTemplate.csproj` file to `{your-project-name}.csproj`
6. VS Code - open the `{your-project-name}` folder
7. VS Code - Edit -> Replace in Files `EdatTemplate` with `{your-project-name]` and select "Replace All" (Ctrl + ALt + Enter)
8. VS Code (optional) - Set the `UserSecretsId` in the .NET Core project to a new value (usually a GUID) and reload new secrets for your new application. All applications deployed on Azure will require their own unique secrets, but developers can use the ones provided by Randy for local development.
9. VS Code - Hit Play! This will run these commands in order...
   - From `{your-project-name}` it runs `dotnet build` -> This restores NuGet packages, builds the .NET Core app, and generates the TypeScript model definition files (model.d.ts)
   - From `{your-project-name}\ClientApp` it runs `npm install` -> This creates the `node_modules` folder and installs the NPM packages defined in the `package.json` file.
   - From `{your-project-name}\ClientApp` it runs `ng serve` -> This builds the client app and starts the Angular-CLI server.
10. Images are served from the `{your-project-name}\ClientApp\dist\assets` folder. Running in VS Code will not create this folder since the Angular-CLI server serves files from in-memory. To get get the images for your application, run `npm run build` from inside the `{your-project-name}\ClientApp` folder at least once.
